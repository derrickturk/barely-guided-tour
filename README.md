barely-guided-tour
==================

a (barely) guided tour of computer science

# CS intro / practical bootstrap [3 weeks]
* a brief history of computation
* Python
* expressions, evaluation, interpretation
* types (shallowly)
* abstraction: functions, subroutines, whatever-you-call-em
* I/O: files & streams
* data structures: arrays, records, hashes (lie about collisions)
* algorithms: search & sort
* applications: calculators, file filters (Unix-style)
* practicum:
    * style
    * documentation
    * version controls
    * command line
    * Unix worldview & tools

# Low level deep dive [3 weeks]
* history: Turing vs. Church
* Von Neumann architecture
* modern computer architecture (vaguely)
* C
* memory & representation
* types (unsound: why?)
* pointers, arrays, records
* data structures: lists, trees
* practicum: compilers, assemblers, linkers, loaders
* applications: calculation DLL for scientific/engineering application?

# Selected readings in interesting shit [3 weeks]
## Functional programming
* Lisp (?)
* Recursion vs. iteration
* FP and parallelism (e.g. map-reduce and "big data")
* closures over state...
## Object-oriented programming
* Definitions and lies
* ... &mu; the Ultimate?
* Python (implement example)
* C (implement toy)
* polymorphism (ad-hoc vs parametric)
* subtyping (structural vs nominal)
## Generic programming
* C++ templates
* structural (sub)typing and compile-time polymorphism
* Haskell?

# Final project?
